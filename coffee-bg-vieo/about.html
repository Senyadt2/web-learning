          <p id="myPara">Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the
             Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds 
             are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles 
             that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.
             is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its 
              caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world[4] and can be prepared and presented in 
              a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, 
              although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste 
              or enhance the flavor. </p>
              <p id="mypara2">It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert, like doughnuts. A commercial establishment 
              that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffeehouse or coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling 
              cannabis). Clinical research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial as a stimulant in healthy 
              adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption has positive or negative effectsThough coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The earliest
              credible evidence of the drinking of coffee in the form of the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen from the mid-15th 
              century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to current methods</p>
